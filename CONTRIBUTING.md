# Contributing to the TUIC Protocol

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the TUIC Protocol!

**Every contribution, no matter how small, is valuable.**

Before you begin, please review our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/tuic-protocol/tuic#coc-ov-file) to ensure a welcoming and respectful community for everyone.

## Understanding the Project

The TUIC project standardizes a network proxy protocol. This repository focuses on the protocol specification itself, not on specific implementations.

Key principles guiding TUIC's development:

- **Community-Driven:** We value collaboration and diverse perspectives. All changes should be discussed and agreed upon by the community.
- **Standardization:** Our goal is a clear, stable, and unambiguous protocol specification. Contributions should address edge cases and ensure consistent behavior across implementations.
- **Implementation-Agnostic:** The specification should be independent of any particular implementation. We focus on refining the protocol design, not implementation details.
- **Simplicity:** The protocol should be easy to understand and implement. Contributions should minimize complexity and strive for elegance.

## Contributing to TUIC Implementations

While this repository focuses on the protocol specification, the TUIC community also maintains various implementations. Contributions to these implementations are highly welcome! You can find a list of implementations [here](https://github.com/tuic-protocol/tuic?tab=readme-ov-file#implementations).

## Contribution Process
